            <p>Maryland set the standard across the Big Ten baseball conference the past few seasons. The team won 120
                games from 2021-2023, including a program record 48 wins in 2022, by far the most wins in the
                conferences across that stretch.</p>
            <p>Under former head coach Rob Vaughn, who departed last summer for Alabama, the Terps won their first-ever
                conference tournament, won the Big Ten regular season title in back-to-back seasons and hosted its first
                NCAA regional in 2022.</p>
            <p>So, rightfully so, expectations were high for Maryland coming into 2024, even with it being the first
                year under new head coach Matt Swope. But after starting out strong, the team has slowly tumbled down
                the standings throughout the season. The Terps, who were predicted to finish third in the Big Ten
                preseason poll, currently sit in 10th place with an 8-10 conference record.</p>

            <h1>The root of the problem</h1>
            <p>While they hold a positive overall record, in large part thanks to a softer non-conference schedule early
                in the season, Maryland has struggled mightily through six weekends of conference play. It lost four Big
                Ten series to Northwestern, Indiana, Michigan and Nebraska.</p>
            <p>The week of April 9 in particular sent Maryland’s season into a downward spiral. Head coach Matt Swope’s
                team lost four out of their five games in that span, including two ugly midweek losses to Georgetown and
                UMBC. Northwestern, the Terps’ weekend opponent, took two out of three games from them.</p>
        </section>

                Diamondback</p>
            <p>Maryland blew three leads in the sixth inning or later of those games — once to Georgetown and twice
                against Northwestern — due to woeful relief pitching and subpar hitting.</p>
            <p>A large reason for their pitching problems is due to a lack of talent. Maryland lost three of its best
                pitchers to the MLB Draft in Jason Savacool, Nick Dean and Nigel Belgrave. Additionally, promising
                freshman Kyle McCoy, the Terps’ third starter when healthy last season, is out for the season with Tommy
                John surgery.</p>
            <p>Savacool and Dean started on Fridays and Saturdays last season — they were drafted in the sixth and 19th
                rounds, respectively. Now, Maryland’s top two starters are Kenny Lippman and Joey McMannis, who sport
                ERAs above five.</p>
            <p>Maryland’s pitching staff currently sits fifth in the Big Ten with a 5.69 earned run average. But with an
                inconsistent bullpen and no clear ace, blown leads continue to be a problem for the Terps late in games.
            </p>
            <p>“We get up four runs,” Swope said April 12, “we can’t lose a four-run lead. You can’t lose a game in that
                situation.”</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h1>What about the hitting?</h1>
            <p>Pitching isn’t the only problem, though. The Terps only scored once Saturday in a 10-run beatdown. They
                cobbled together just two runs against UMBC on Wednesday in a 4-2 loss to a team ranked outside the
                top-200 in rating percentage index (RPI).</p>
            <p>Maryland hasn’t hit for the same power numbers as last year when it rolled through the Big Ten with a
                conference-leading 131 homers. It also isn’t leading the Big Ten in batting average, on-base percentage
                and slugging percentage like it did in 2023.</p>
            <p>But Swope knew his team wouldn’t replicate the absurd numbers it put up at the plate after losing Matt
                Shaw, Luke Shliger and Nick Lorusso — three 2023 MLB draft picks.</p>
            <p>“We’ve definitely been missing out a little bit this season where in the past we’ve kind of relied on
                that,” Swope said.</p>
            <p>Maryland remains top five in the Big Ten in hits and homers. But it ranks in the bottom half of the
                conference in RBIs, on-base percentage and slugging percentage.</p>

                style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="406" data-external="1"></iframe>
            <script type="text/javascript">!function () { "use strict"; window.addEventListener("message", (function (a) { if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"]) { var e = document.querySelectorAll("iframe"); for (var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"]) for (var r = 0; r < e.length; r++)if (e[r].contentWindow === a.source) { var i = a.data["datawrapper-height"][t] + "px"; e[r].style.height = i } } })) }();
            </script>
            <p>The Terps no longer terrorize Big Ten pitchers at the plate. Their failure to score runs late in games
                last
                weekend
                is proof. That paired with a pitching staff that’s allowed 9.8 runs a game over its last 12 contests
                hasn’t
                been
                a
                winning combination.</p>
            <p>If Swope’s squad wants to make another run to the postseason, it must find other ways to win.</p>
